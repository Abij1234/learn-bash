1) our 1st command is 'ls'
The ls command is used to view the contents of a directory.
By default, this command will display the contents of your current working directory.
If you want to see the content of other
directories, type ls and then the directory‚Äôs
path. For example, enter ls /home/username/Documents
to view the content of Documents.

ls -R = by typing these we can see all the  list of the files in the sub-directories as well" | pv -qL 100 | lolcat

2) our next command is 'pwd'
'pwd' is a command that is used to know our current working directory
by using it gave the current working directory like path ok

directory like these you can see all the path of all directory's
and files" | pv -qL 100 | lolcat

3) our next command is 'mkdir'
Use mkdir command to make a new directory
if you type mkdir Music it will create a directory called Music.

To generate a new directory inside another directory, use this Linux basic command
'mkdir Music/Newfile' ok like these we can make directory inside a
directory" | pv -qL 100 | lolcat

6) our next command is 'cp'
Use the 'cp' command to copy files from the current directory to a different directory.
